/* Calculate total playing time of a song.
Will detect tempo changing commands as long as they are on first line of block,
otherwise it would have been too slow. So calculated time is average.
Premature ends of blocks ad stop commands like FFE are not detected. 
As a matter of fact OctaMED allows you to set blocks length so premature end makes not sense.
Will work only on BPM tempos.
While processing PLAY is active so weird audio is supposed to be heard. This is normal :)
